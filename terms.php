Once a website has been designed and completed the final balance of payment is then due in accordance with our payment terms. There are no exceptions to this, i.e If the client decides they no longer want the site, as they have commissioned the work and paid a deposit they are still obliged to pay for the work that has been done. Non payment will result in legal action being taken if necessary.


<b>Database, Application and E-Commerce Development</b>

MindLogics cannot take responsibility for any losses incurred by the use of any software created for the client. Whilst every care has been taken to ensure products are problem free and accurate, the ultimate responsibility lies with the client in ensuring that all software is functioning correctly before use.

Where large applications are to be developed, it is the clients responsibility to provide a suitable testing environment which is identical to the final production environment.

The client is expected to test fully any application or programming relating to a site developed by MindLogics before being made generally available for use. Where â€œbugs???, errors or other issues are found after the site is live, MindLogics will endeavor (but is not obliged to) to correct these issues to meet the standards of function outlined in the brief.
